Here is a quick guide for the Trader Server settings

"can-be-purchased" : "false"},

"can-be-purchased" : "default"},

"can-be-purchased" : "true"},


false - Item wont get listet

default - only lists item if the trader sells it by default

true - list the item in traders inventory


Change Prices:

{"tradeable-code" : "1H_Brass_Knuckles", "base-purchase-price" : "-1", "base-sell-price" : "-1", "delta-price" : "-1.0", "can-be-purchased" : "true"},

"base-purchase-price" : "-1"	- Sets the Price the Trader sells the Item for, change to your wanted value

"base-sell-price" : "-1"		- Changes the Price you can sell a certain Item for, change to your wanted value

"delta-price" : "-1.0"			- mulitplies purchase and sell price by x, if set to "2" for example both numbers will be doubled

Full list of Items(most likley a few missing)

You can copy the list into any Trader manually after you changed the stuff you wanted

Also .json files can not have returns or comments in it, sorry for the wall of text
